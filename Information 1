I tried several courses and looked into different educational avenues to try and find answers, but most of them only teach theory and don't provide practical, real-world solutions for new developers.<br>

So there are two things I want to share with you.<br>

First, here's a list of resources I've put together that will provide you with a lot of relief as you continue learning. Oh, and this list is LONG, so be sure to stay tuned for tomorrow's email for the other major solution that will help you become a master!<br>

ðŸ‘‰ Illustrations<br>
